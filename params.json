{"name":"Controlledvocabulary","tagline":"Controlled Vocabulary","body":"This project provides tools to control the vocabulary of email and meeting communications so that recipients may implement more effective filtering.\r\n\r\nAre you a member of an email discussion alias which is out of control? Do you battle to filter the messages? Take a look at the solution provided by this project to bring your alias under control again.\r\n\r\nThe driving motivation behind this project is that [controlled vocabulary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_vocabulary) is a more effective method of categorizing emails than an open tagging system, which is too subjective.\r\n\r\nThis project provides an Outlook 2013 and Windows Client to support the adoption of a Controlled Vocabulary.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
