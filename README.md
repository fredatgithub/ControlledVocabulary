Controlled Vocabulary
====================

This project provides tools to control the vocabulary of email and meeting communications so that recipients may implement more effective filtering.

*Are you a member of an email discussion alias which is out of control? Do you battle to filter the messages? Take a look at the solution provided by this project to bring your alias under control again.*

The driving motivation behind this project is that  Controlled Vocabulary is a more effective method of categorizing emails than an open tagging system, which is too subjective.

This project provides an Outlook 2010 and Windows Client to support the adoption of a Controlled Vocabulary, e.g. the Outlook 2010 Add-in is shown below
